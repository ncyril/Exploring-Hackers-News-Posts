    "# Exploring Hackers News Posts üöÄ\n",
    "In this project, we will conduct a comparative analysis of two distinct post categories on Hacker News, a renowned platform where users engage with technology-related stories by voting and providing comments. These two post categories are denoted by the prefixes \"Ask HN\" and \"Show HN.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Users employ Ask HN posts to pose specific questions to the Hacker News community, such as inquiries like \"What is the best online course you've ever taken?\" Conversely, users employ Show HN posts to showcase projects, products, or simply something captivating to the Hacker News audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our primary objectives in this analysis are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine which category, Ask HN or Show HN, garners a higher average number of comments.\n",
    "2. Investigate whether the timing of post creation has an influence on the average number of comments received.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to mention that the dataset we are utilizing underwent a reduction process, where it was trimmed from nearly 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows. This reduction was accomplished by excluding submissions that did not receive any comments and then selecting a random sample from the remaining submissions."

    "In this project, we conducted an analysis of ask posts and show posts to determine which type of post and what time of day typically receive the highest average number of comments. Based on our findings, if your goal is to maximize the number of comments a post receives, we recommend categorizing it as an ask post and creating it between 15:00 and 16:00 (3:00 pm EST - 4:00 pm EST).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's essential to acknowledge that our analysis was based on a dataset that excluded posts with zero comments. Therefore, it's more precise to state that among the posts that did receive comments, ask posts tended to receive more comments on average, with ask posts created between 15:00 and 16:00 (3:00 pm EST - 4:00 pm EST) receiving the highest average number of comments."
